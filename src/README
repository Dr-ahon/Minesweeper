# About project

This is the first version of my semestral program. It is classic minesweeper. Main goal is to clear the whole board 
without hitting any mine. Tiles are labeled with numbers, that express number of mines adjacent to that tile. 
When discovering a non-mine tile, all adjacent zero tiles expand. Tile can be choosen by typing its coords f.e. "a 1",
flagged by typing "f a 1" and unflagged by the same line.



## TODO:
- add custom board sizes
- add time counting
- manage incorrect inputs
- properly test it and solve possible bugs
